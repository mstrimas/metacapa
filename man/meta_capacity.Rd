\title{Metapopulation capacity}
\usage{
meta_capacity(x, a, f, ex = 0.5, self = TRUE, patch_mc = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{interpatch distance matrix or \link{patch_config} object.}

\item{a}{numeric; patch areas in the same order as the distance matrix.
Only used if `x`` is a distance matrix.}

\item{f}{function; dispersal kernel function taking a distance, \code{d}, and
returning the probability density of dispersing that distance.}

\item{ex}{numeric; extinction-area parameter, where extinction rate is given
by \eqn{E / A^ex} for patch size \eqn{A}.}

\item{self}{logical; whether patches can recolonize themselves, this
correction was proposed by Schnell et al. (2013) because the original
favours networks of small patches over large contiguous patches}

\item{patch_mc}{logical; whether to return the patch-level contributions to
the metapopulation capacity.}

\item{...}{additional parameters passed to the dispersal survival function.}
}
\value{
The metapopulation capacity or, if \code{patch_mc = TRUE}, a list
containing the metapopulation capacity (\code{capacity}) and the patch
contributions (\code{patch_mc}).
}
\description{
Metapopulation capacity (Hanski and Ovaskainen 2000) is a relative measure of
the ability of a spatially explicit landscape to support a metapopulation of
a species. This function implements the modification proposed by Schnell et
al. (2013) that includes self colonization.
